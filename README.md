Portuguese Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction — Business Case

In the competitive banking industry, customer acquisition and retention are vital for long-term profitability.

This project focuses on improving the effectiveness of telemarketing campaigns by predicting which customers are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit.

Leveraging machine learning and data analytics, it provides actionable insights that help banks target potential customers more efficiently and reduce campaign costs.

 Objective

Develop a machine learning-based classification system to predict term deposit subscriptions.

Analyze customer demographics, previous campaign data, and economic indicators to understand behavioral trends.

Identify key drivers of customer decisions that impact campaign outcomes.

Enable data-driven marketing strategies for better customer targeting and conversion.

 Aim of the Project

Build an end-to-end predictive pipeline for campaign success using structured bank data.

Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover significant relationships between customer features and subscription behavior.

Perform feature engineering to handle categorical and numerical data effectively.

Train, tune, and evaluate multiple classification algorithms — including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Select the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
